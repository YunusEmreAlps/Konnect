## Folder structure
There's two different folders. Each of them is a Dart project.

* **core**: contains the pure Dart business logic, such API communication, Redux, XML parsing, sanitization, i18n, models and utilities. 
It also has a great test coverage.
* **ui**: this is the Flutter project. It imports **core**, and it's a 100% shared codebase for the native Android & iOS apps that go on app stores.
