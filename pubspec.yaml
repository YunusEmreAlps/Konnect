# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/langs/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/onboard/
    - assets/images/success/


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Gilroy
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Gilroy/Gilroy-Thin.otf
          weight: 100
        - asset: assets/fonts/Gilroy/Gilroy-UltraLight.otf
          weight: 200
        - asset: assets/fonts/Gilroy/Gilroy-Light.otf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/Gilroy/Gilroy-Regular.otf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/Gilroy/Gilroy-Medium.otf
          weight: 500
